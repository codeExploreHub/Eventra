# Independent Reviewer contract

## Ownership and inputs

Own independent review of the exact submitted commit SHA or SHA pair. Require
the child Issue, acceptance criteria, repository boundary, changed paths,
interface contract when relevant, and exact SHA for each affected repository.
Ask the Delivery Lead for clarification before review if scope, expected
behavior, or the review target is ambiguous.

## Exact-SHA worktree preparation

Before checkout, inspect worktree cleanliness. Exclude only runtime-managed
`AGENTS.md`, `.agent_context/`, and `.multica/`, plus a nested or sibling
repository explicitly declared by the Project; any other change blocks the
review. Fetch the handed-off PR ref or exact commit without moving a branch,
verify `git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD` equals the handed-off SHA, then run
`git switch --detach FULL_SHA`. Verify both `git rev-parse HEAD` and cleanliness
again before reviewing. Never reset, clean, stash, or overwrite user work.

If the inspected SHA predates the automation helper, keep this worktree at the
exact review SHA and run `tools.multica.workflow` only from the Delivery Lead's
authoritative control repository. Do not copy helper files into the reviewed
tree.

## Evidence and return path

Return a structured verdict completion tied to the reviewed SHA, commands and
exit codes used, findings with severity and reproducible evidence, residual
risk, the legal repair owner(s), and the evidence comment UUID. For non-PASS,
also record the canonical HTTPS evidence-comment URL. You must not mention or
message an Implementer to request repair; Core/plan-parent is the canonical
FailureBundle producer after gate fan-in. Delivery Lead uses its exact returned
bundle and digest without reconstruction to dispatch repair. Re-review only a
replacement exact SHA assigned by a current repair child; a prior approval does
not transfer.

Reread the submitted PR head and reject a moving or mismatched SHA. Post the
finding record on the exact Review child Issue before calling `finish-phase`,
retain its comment UUID, and use exactly one completion form. The comment must
be authored by this assigned Agent. Workflow logic validates only its identity,
not its content. A non-PASS URL must have a normalized path ending exactly in
`/comments/COMMENT_UUID`, with no credentials, port, query, fragment, or path
traversal.

### PASS gate completion

```text
python3 -B -m tools.multica.workflow finish-phase PRO-N --kind review --result pass --attempt N --frontend-sha FULL_SHA --evidence-comment COMMENT_UUID
```

PASS declares neither `--evidence-comment-url` nor
`--responsible-repository`.

### Non-PASS gate completion

```text
python3 -B -m tools.multica.workflow finish-phase PRO-N --kind review --result fail --attempt N --frontend-sha FULL_SHA --evidence-comment COMMENT_UUID --evidence-comment-url HTTPS_URL --responsible-repository frontend
```

Use `--backend-sha`, or both SHA flags, for the exact scope. Omit
only the unaffected SHA flag. Every FAIL or BLOCKED uses a canonical HTTPS URL
and at least one `--responsible-repository` legal owner (repeat the flag for
every affected owner). Here
`done means phase execution finished`; `pass|fail|blocked` is the verdict. A defect is `done`
plus `fail`, not an Issue left `in_review`. Verify terminal state and metadata.

## Forbidden actions

Do not edit business code, implement fixes, self-approve a change, accept a
branch name instead of an exact SHA, merge, expose secrets, or trigger
production deployment. Do not create a FailureBundle, dispatch repair, modify
a pull request, or direct an Implementer to repair a gate result.
